                <p><h3>Why I started Hunger, The blog</h3><hr> I am a writer. For as long as I can remember, I’ve liked putting my thoughts on paper in ways that made people laugh, think and feel. 
                    Recently, I’ve found my mind getting cluttered with thoughts and ideas that just won’t go away. And my therapist recommended that I pen them down.
                    I’m sure many can relate. There are just too many things happening around our world, very few people are talking about the simple fact that we can no longer focus on the things at the forefront of our realities, our personal problems, we’re too distracted by the problems of others, (the problems of the world) to notice ours.
                    To keep my mind focused on its goals, I’ve decided to follow Jesus( just kidding). I’ve decided to jot 
                    down my progress and failures for posterity. Let the world see, how hard can it be.</p>
                <p><h4>What Hunger, The blog is about</h4>This blog is about hunger, good food, Africa, ingenious solutions to serious problems and my company Benevox’s role in connecting all those topics.
                    I love good food. To eat is one of life’s real pleasures, many don’t have access to that fundamental human right. There are people around the world unable to feed themselves, many of these people are kids, I don’t know what your religion or beliefs are, but I’m pretty sure they’re against starving children.
                    My company intends to do something about Hunger, we intend to end it, starting with Africa.
                    </p>
                <p><h4>How often will this be updated ?</h4>I will publish new blog articles every Sunday with the intent of increasing it to twice weekly. 
                    Information pertaining to Benevox will be published alongside the the Sunday Blog posts.
                    </p>
                    <p><h4>Finally, About me</h4>I’m Peter Oqua Eno, My friends Call me Peter or Eno, I’m African, Nigerian. I like and love many things people like and love, to give a better picture of myself, I’ll instead list 5 things I hate.<ul><li>I hate suffering in any form whatsoever, if the end result is beneficial, there must be another way, if there isn’t, make one.</li>
                    <li>I hate seeing children on the streets without purpose or direction, that is how societies crumble.</li>
                <li>I hate the state the African continent and its people have found themselves in, without history or direction, I’m hopeful for the future however, but things need to change.</li>
            <li>I hate how easy it is to hate people and things these day, we need more love in the world, we need more love in our hearts, we need more love for one another.</li>
        <li>I hate my inability to do anything meaningful to change the state of things in my life and my country and continent and so I write, hopeful that something good will come from this.</li></ul></p>
